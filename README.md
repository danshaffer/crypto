Masatano Crypto Challenges
======

These are my solutions to the [Masatano Crypto Challenges](http://cryptopals.com/). I'm trying it out in golang, which I'm really starting to like. It's got a lot of the nice things from Python like 

```
for idx, elem := range arr {
```

but also has the advantage of being statically typed. (I originally started the challenges in Python but got caught up in encoding issues - these challenges require you to deal with strings, byte arrays, base-64-encoded strings, hex-encoded strings, and translate between them with fluency. That's pretty hard if you don't have a type system :)
